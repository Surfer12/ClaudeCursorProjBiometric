# Visualization and Diagram Package: Meso-Level Conceptual Mapping

## Purpose
This directory contains visual representations of complex cognitive and neurological concepts, providing graphical insights into the project's theoretical frameworks.

## Contents
- SVG visualizations
- Mermaid diagram files
- State flow diagrams
- Network circuit representations
- Cognitive state mappings

## Visualization Types
- Network state transitions
- Cognitive architecture
- Performance interconnections
- Metabolic supports
- Enhanced performance mapping

## Rationale
Visual representations are crucial in translating complex theoretical models into comprehensible formats. These diagrams serve multiple purposes:
- Simplify complex neurological concepts
- Provide visual models of cognitive state transitions
- Illustrate interconnections between different cognitive and metabolic systems
- Support scientific communication and understanding
