# Enhanced Security Framework for Agent Code Creation

## 1. System-Level Command Restrictions

### 1.1 System Modification Denials
```bash
# Block system-level modifications
sudo chmod
sudo chown
sudo systemctl
sudo service
sudo mount
sudo umount
sudo fdisk
sudo mkfs
sudo dd
sudo
su
sysctl -w
firewall-cmd
ufw

1.2 Network Security Restrictions
bash
# Block potentially dangerous network operations
nc
netcat
nmap
tcpdump
wireshark
ssh-keygen
openssl
telnet
ssh
ftp

1.3 File System Protection
bash
# Block dangerous file operations
rm -rf
rmdir -p
find . -delete
shred
del /f /q

2. Development Environment Protections
2.1 Version Control Restrictions
bash
# Block potentially destructive git operations
git push --force
git reset --hard
git clean -fd
git branch -D

2.2 Build System Restrictions
bash
# Block build system modifications
gradle init
maven init
ant build
make install
cmake ..

2.3 IDE and Editor Configurations
bash
# Block global configuration changes
code --install-extension
vim --cmd
emacs --batch

3. Language-Specific Package Management
3.1 Java Environment
bash
# Block JDK/JRE modifications
java -jar
javac -source
maven deploy
gradle publish

3.2 Python Environment
bash
# Block virtual environment modifications
virtualenv
python -m venv
conda create
conda install
pip freeze

3.3 Node.js Security
bash
# Block global package installations
npm audit fix
npm update -g
yarn upgrade
pnpm install -g

4. Enhanced Allowlist Framework
4.1 Development Operations
bash
# Allow specific development commands
git status
git diff
git log
git branch
git checkout -b
git
vim
emacs
vscode
gcc
clang
javac
python3

4.2 Build and Test Operations
bash
# Allow specific build commands
npm run test
npm run build
gradle test
mvn test
python -m pytest
make
gradle
maven

4.3 Code Analysis Operations
bash
# Allow code quality tools
eslint .
pylint
checkstyle
spotbugs
pytest
unittest
mocha
jest

5. Security Monitoring Framework
5.1 Logging Requirements
Command execution history
Failed command attempts
Resource utilization metrics
System call tracing

5.2 Audit Mechanisms
Regular security scans
Dependency vulnerability checks
Configuration drift detection
Access pattern analysis

6. Implementation Guidelines
6.1 Integration Protocol
Implement command filtering at shell level
Configure IDE security policies
Establish monitoring endpoints
Deploy logging infrastructure

6.2 Maintenance Protocol
Weekly security policy reviews
Monthly allowlist/denylist updates
Quarterly security audit
Continuous vulnerability scanning

7. Emergency Response Protocol
7.1 Violation Handling
Immediate command termination
Session isolation
Audit log generation
Security team notification

7.2 Recovery Procedures
Environment restoration
Policy adjustment
Incident documentation
Prevention analysis

Additional Considerations
Expanding the Denylist: 
Modify system settings: Commands like sysctl or ufw can alter system behavior in unintended ways. 
Install or remove software: Tools like apt, yum, or snap can introduce or remove software that might not be vetted for security.
Execute scripts: Direct script execution can bypass security measures if scripts contain malicious code.
Network operations: Commands like telnet or ssh might expose the system to unauthorized access.
System information gathering: Commands such as ifconfig or lsof can be used to gather information for malicious purposes.
Potentially malicious commands: Tools like wget or curl can download and execute code from the internet.

Refining the Allowlist:
Essential development tools: Only allow tools necessary for development to minimize the attack surface.
Testing tools: Ensure testing frameworks are allowed to support continuous integration practices.
Build tools: Limit to specific commands that do not modify system-wide settings.
Cloud-specific tools: Ensure access to cloud services is controlled and monitored.

Implementation Considerations:
Continuous Monitoring: Security is dynamic; regular updates to both allow and deny lists are crucial.
Granular Control: Use regex or pattern matching for more precise command control to avoid false positives or negatives.
User Feedback: Developer input is invaluable to adjust policies without hindering productivity.
Testing: Test in a sandbox environment to ensure rules do not block legitimate operations.
Documentation: Maintain clear documentation to explain why each command is listed, aiding in future reviews and adjustments.

By implementing this framework, you enhance the security posture of your development environment, potentially reducing risks associated with code execution and data handling while still supporting productive development practices.
