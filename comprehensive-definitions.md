# Neural-Metabolic State Integration Framework

## Core State Definitions

### Dawn State
**Experiential Definition:**
The transition period from sleep to wake where cognitive architecture rebuilds itself. Like the systematic boot-up of a complex system, each neural network comes online in a specific sequence.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Heightened ketone utilization
- Enhanced pattern recognition
- Reduced executive demand

**Action Items:**
1. Temperature manipulation (cold exposure)
2. Light exposure sequencing
3. Movement pattern initiation

### Peak State
**Experiential Definition:**
The zone of optimal cognitive performance where pattern recognition and execution converge. Similar to an athlete's "flow state" but specifically tuned to cognitive demands.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Mixed substrate utilization
- High network coherence
- Enhanced task switching

**Action Items:**
1. Task complexity progression
2. Environmental optimization
3. Resource management protocols

### Recovery State
**Experiential Definition:**
Not merely rest, but active integration of learned patterns and experiences. Like defragmentation of a hard drive while simultaneously upgrading its software.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Fat adaptation dominance
- Pattern consolidation
- Network recalibration

**Action Items:**
1. Progressive deloading
2. Temperature manipulation
3. Parasympathetic activation

## Network Definitions

### Default Mode Network (DMN)
**Experiential Definition:**
Your brain's "idle state" that's actually highly active in self-referential thinking and pattern integration. Think of it as your mind's research and development department.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Self-referential processing
- Pattern integration
- Future scenario modeling

### Task Positive Network (TPN)
**Experiential Definition:**
The focused, external attention network. Like a spotlight that illuminates specific tasks while dimming background processes.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Directed attention
- Goal-oriented processing
- External focus

### Salience Network
**Experiential Definition:**
Your brain's relevance detection system. Acts like an advanced filter that decides what deserves attention and what can be processed automatically.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Priority assessment
- Network switching
- Attention allocation

## Integration Mechanisms

### State Transitions
**Experiential Definition:**
The active process of shifting between neural states. Similar to changing gears in a manual transmission - requires timing, awareness, and practice.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Temperature sensitivity
- Metabolic shifts
- Network reconfigurations

### Pattern Recognition
**Experiential Definition:**
The ability to identify and utilize complex relationships across domains. Like having a universal translation system for experience.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Cross-domain integration
- Implicit learning
- Adaptive response

### Flow Access
**Experiential Definition:**
The systematic entry into high-performance states. Not chance, but a reproducible process based on specific triggers and conditions.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Challenge/skill balance
- Clear goals
- Immediate feedback
