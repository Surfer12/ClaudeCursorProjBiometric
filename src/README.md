# Source Code Package: Micro-Level Implementation Architecture

## Purpose
This directory contains the implementation of our cognitive and biometric monitoring framework, translating theoretical models into functional software components.

## Structure
### `/monitoring/`
- Biometric stream processing
- Treatment session monitoring
- State transition tracking

### `/types/`
- Type definitions
- Utility functions for biometric data handling

### `/framework/`
- Core cognitive state management
- Framework initialization
- Interaction and integration components

## Key Technologies
- TypeScript
- React
- Biometric data processing
- Cognitive state monitoring

## Rationale
The source code package is the practical manifestation of our theoretical research. It bridges scientific understanding with technological implementation, providing:
- Real-time cognitive state analysis
- Robust biometric data processing
- Flexible framework for neurological monitoring
- Scientifically grounded software architecture
