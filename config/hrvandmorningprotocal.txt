Would you like me to implement these additional features? // Your question

Yes // Below is for your reference.

“Looking at the Network Rehabilitation Strategy from the documentation, we should add the following features:

Morning Protocol Integration:

Temperature monitoring (correlates with your cold exposure practices)
Progressive timing tracking (5-7-10 minutes)
HRV validation metrics” 

HRV coherence tracking as it's a validated marker for autonomic nervous system state, which correlates strongly with both anxiety levels and flow state access. // This is important for me to understand so lets provide some analysis capabilities for this as i discuss later data availability.

 Also, given your background in biopsychology,  // Your question
 would you prefer to see the raw data streams or processed metrics? // Your question
 
 Raw data streams. An example is it during sessions of treatment I will record continuously my heart rate as well as blood oxygen level and other watchOS features that are on during exercise, which I'll have to look up to reference as a continuous analysis point. I'll have to grab this data as of now.
