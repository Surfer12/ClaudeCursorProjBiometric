Let me break down a comprehensive plan for implementing this system, starting with the foundational concepts and moving through to advanced integration. Given your background in biopsychology and emerging interest in React/TypeScript, I'll structure this to build mental models that bridge both domains.
</thinking>

<thinking>
First, let's outline the project structure and required technologies:

1. Development Environment:
- Node.js (runtime environment)
- npm (package manager)
- TypeScript compiler
- React development tools
- Visual Studio Code (recommended IDE)
</thinking>

<thinking>
Let's create a step-by-step implementation plan that maps to cognitive learning patterns:

Phase 1: Foundation Setup
Phase 2: Component Architecture
Phase 3: Data Flow Implementation
Phase 4: Integration Testing
</thinking>

Let's start with Phase 1: Foundation Setup

```bash
# Project initialization
npx create-next-app@latest cognitive-state-monitor --typescript --tailwind
cd cognitive-state-monitor

# Install required dependencies
npm install recharts lucide-react @radix-ui/react-slot lodash
npm install -D @types/lodash
```

Project Structure:
```plaintext
cognitive-state-monitor/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── monitoring/
│   │   │   ├── BiometricProcessor.tsx
│   │   │   ├── TreatmentMonitor.tsx
│   │   │   └── MedicationTracker.tsx
│   │   └── ui/
│   │       └── [shadcn components]
│   ├── types/
│   │   └── monitoring.ts
│   ├── utils/
│   │   ├── biometrics.ts
│   │   └── analysis.ts
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.tsx
└── package.json
```

<thinking>
Let's break down the implementation into cognitive chunks, starting with our core types:
</thinking>

1. First, create the types file (`src/types/monitoring.ts`):



<thinking>
Now, let's create our utility functions for biometric analysis. This bridges your biopsychology knowledge with technical implementation:
</thinking>



<thinking>
Would you like me to continue with:
1. Setting up the main React components?
2. Implementing the data flow architecture?
3. Creating the UI layout structure?

Also, do you have any specific questions about the TypeScript/React concepts I've introduced so far? I can provide more detailed explanations of:
- Type interfaces and their role
- React component structure
- State management patterns
- Data processing utilities
</thinking>

Let me know which aspect you'd like to explore next, and I'll provide a detailed breakdown with cognitive mapping to help build your mental model of the system.
