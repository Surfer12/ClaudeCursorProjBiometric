The IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics standards, particularly in neurological data visualization, emphasize several key principles that we've incorporated:

Temporal coherence in data presentation
Multi-modal data integration
Real-time performance optimization
Visual encoding of complex state transitions
