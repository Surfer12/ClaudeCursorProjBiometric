# Cognitive Monitoring Framework

## Project Overview
A comprehensive research and software implementation project bridging theoretical neurological models with practical software solutions for cognitive state monitoring and analysis.

## Project Structure
- `/docs/`: Theoretical documentation and framework descriptions
- `/research/`: Exploratory notes and preliminary research
- `/diagrams/`: Visual representations of cognitive models
- `/src/`: Implementation of cognitive monitoring software
- `/config/`: System and environment configurations
- `/security/`: Access control and security mechanisms
