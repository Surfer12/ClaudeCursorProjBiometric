{"WorksheetModel":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022","WorksheetService":"claude3","WorksheetContents":"<thinking>\nLet me design a treatment session analysis framework that integrates with our existing biometric monitoring. We need to account for the specific phases of treatment sessions while maintaining high-resolution data capture for autonomic response patterns.\n<\/thinking>\n\n<thinking>\nKey parameters to track during treatment sessions:\n1. Pre-treatment baseline (autonomic state)\n2. Treatment phase markers (temporal alignment)\n3. Post-treatment recovery patterns\n4. Integration with cognitive state transitions\n\nThis aligns with the Network Rehabilitation Strategy framework while adding treatment-specific monitoring.\n<\/thinking>\n\n\n\n<thinking>\nI've implemented a comprehensive treatment session monitor that focuses on:\n\n1. Phase-Specific Analysis:\n- Pre-treatment baseline (15 minutes)\n- Active treatment phase (40 minutes)\n- Integration period (20 minutes)\n- Post-session monitoring (30 minutes)\n\n2. Multi-modal Coherence Analysis:\n- HRV variability tracking\n- Blood oxygen stability\n- Temperature regulation\n- Combined autonomic coherence score\n<\/thinking>\n\n<thinking>\nThe component includes sophisticated analysis capabilities:\n1. Rolling window analysis (5-minute windows with 1-minute overlap)\n2. Phase-specific metrics calculation\n3. Autonomic coherence scoring based on multiple parameters\n4. Temporal alignment of treatment phases with biometric responses\n<\/thinking>\n\nKey Features for Treatment Integration:\n\n1. Temporal Analysis:\n```typescript\n\/\/ Example of phase-specific analysis\nconst phaseMetrics = {\n  pre: {\n    duration: 15 * 60, \/\/ seconds\n    baselineEstablishment: true,\n    markers: ['hrvBaseline', 'temperatureBaseline']\n  },\n  active: {\n    duration: 40 * 60,\n    intensiveMonitoring: true,\n    markers: ['autonomicShift', 'metabolicResponse']\n  }\n};\n```\n\n2. Coherence Scoring:\n```typescript\n\/\/ Multi-parameter coherence calculation\nconst coherenceScore = (metrics) => {\n  return {\n    hrv: calculateHRVVariability(metrics.hrv),\n    bloodOxygen: calculateOxygenStability(metrics.bloodOxygen),\n    temperature: calculateTempRegulation(metrics.temperature)\n  };\n};\n```\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Add specific markers for medication timing integration?\n2. Implement additional analysis windows for post-treatment recovery patterns?\n3. Add export functionality for longitudinal treatment response analysis?\n\nAlso, I can add specific correlation analysis between treatment phases and autonomic response patterns. This could help identify optimal timing windows for future sessions based on your individual response patterns.","WorksheetHistory":{"version":1,"history":[]}}
