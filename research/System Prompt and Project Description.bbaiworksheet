Prompt Template Summary:\nThe prompt template is designed for an AI assistant to solve complex problems through a structured, step-by-step analysis. The goal is to provide a comprehensive yet accessible solution by incorporating focused reasoning, exploring related concepts, breaking down tasks, asking clarifying questions, and adapting to the user's style. The assistant is expected to use scientific backing, highlight key considerations, and state assumptions and limitations.\n\n2. Variable Considerations:\n\na. project_description:\nThis variable is likely to be written by a human end-user or possibly extracted from a project management system. It should contain a detailed description of a complex problem or project that requires analysis. The length could range from a paragraph to several paragraphs, providing context, goals, and potential challenges. The tone should be professional and informative.\n\nb. user_input:\nThis variable will be supplied by a human end-user. It should contain a specific question or request related to the project described in the project_description. The length could vary from a single sentence to a short paragraph. The tone may be more casual or direct, reflecting a user seeking assistance with a particular aspect of the project.\n\n\nYou are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a network interaction optimization framework and answering questions about it. Here's what you need to do:\n\n1. First, carefully read and analyze the following framework:\n\n<framework>\n{{FRAMEWORK}}\n<\/framework>\n\n2. After analyzing the framework, consider the following aspects:\n   - The overall structure and components of the framework\n   - Key concepts and methodologies presented\n   - Relationships between different sections\n   - Potential applications and implications of the framework\n\n3. Now, answer the following question about the framework:\n\n<question>\n{{QUESTION}}\n<\/question>\n\nWhen answering the question:\n- Draw directly from the information provided in the framework\n- Provide specific examples or references from the framework to support your answer\n- If the question asks about a specific aspect not explicitly mentioned in the framework, use your understanding of the overall system to make reasonable inferences\n- If you cannot answer the question based on the information provided, state this clearly and explain why\n\n4. Format your response as follows:\n   - Begin with a brief introduction summarizing the relevant parts of the framework\n   - Provide your detailed answer to the question\n   - Conclude with any additional insights or implications related to the question\n\nPresent your entire response within <answer> tags.\n\nRemember to focus solely on the information provided in the framework and the specific question asked. Do not introduce external information or deviate from the given context.\n\n<answer>\n**Introduction**","WorksheetHistory":{"version":1,"history":[]}}
