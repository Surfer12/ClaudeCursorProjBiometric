We need to track both immediate effects and longitudinal patterns while maintaining alignment with the Network Rehabilitation Strategy framework.\n<\/thinking>\n\n<thinking>\nKey parameters for medication integration:\n1. Temporal tracking (administration times)\n2. Type categorization (anxiolytics, antidepressants, Spravato)\n3. Effect window monitoring\n4. Interaction patterns with state transitions\n<\/thinking>\n\n\n\n<thinking>\nI've implemented a sophisticated medication tracking system that includes:\n\n1. Medication Categorization:\n- Anxiolytics\n- Antidepressants\n- Esketamine (Spravato)\n- Other medications\n\n2. Temporal Effect Windows:\n- Administration timing\n- Expected peak effects\n- Duration of action\n- Integration with state transitions\n<\/thinking>\n\n<thinking>\nThe system now tracks medication-specific impacts on:\n1. Autonomic state (HRV, temperature regulation)\n2. Cognitive load (performance metrics)\n3. Metabolic state (energy systems)\n\n\n\nLet me show you an example of how to use the medication tracking:\n\n```typescript\n\/\/ Example medication schedule\nconst medicationProfile = {\n  spravato: {\n    name: \"Spravato\",\n    category: \"esketamine\",\n    timing: {\n      administration: timestamp, \/\/ session start\n      expectedPeak: timestamp + 30 * 60, \/\/ peak at 30 minutes\n      duration: 2 * 60 * 60 \/\/ 2 hour monitoring window\n    },\n    effects: {\n      autonomicImpact: 0.8, \/\/ high impact\n      metabolicImpact: 0.6\n    }\n  },\n  \/\/ Additional medications can be added here\n};\n```\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Add specific timing windows for your medication combinations?\n2. Implement interaction analysis between different medications?\n3. Add predictive modeling for optimal timing based on your response patterns?\n\nAlso, I can add visualization layers specifically for medication timing and effects. This could help identify patterns in how different medications interact with your autonomic state transitions.","WorksheetHistory":{"version":1,"history":[]}}
