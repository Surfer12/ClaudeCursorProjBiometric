I'll create visualizations that map both our current cognitive state integration architecture and future development paths. Given your background in biopsychology and experience with flow states, I'll focus on mapping state transitions that are particularly relevant to performance optimization and neurological monitoring.

We need two key visualizations:
1. Current State Integration Map - showing implemented components and their interactions
2. Future Development Pathway - highlighting areas for expansion and deeper integration
</thinking>

Given your background in biopsychology and interest in flow states, let's create a React component that specifically maps these state transitions and their neurological correlates.

The current architecture demonstrates our implemented features:
1. Biometric data capture (HRV, temperature, blood oxygen)
2. Real-time state analysis
3. Medication timing integration
4. Basic visualization

The future architecture outlines upcoming enhancements:
1. Advanced sensor integration (EEG, GSR)
2. Machine learning-based state prediction
3. Flow state detection algorithms
4. Personalized protocol development
</thinking>

Would you like me to:
1. Detail the implementation strategy for any specific component?
2. Create additional visualizations for specific state transitions?
3. Elaborate on the integration points between current and future architectures?

This framework provides a roadmap for development while maintaining alignment with your research interests in quantifiable measurements and cognitive state optimization.
