# Documentation Package: Macro-Level Theoretical Framework

## Purpose
This directory contains comprehensive documentation and theoretical frameworks that underpin the neurological and cognitive modeling project.

## Contents
- Theoretical framework descriptions
- Comprehensive system definitions
- Brain zone analysis
- Network state optimization strategies
- Security framework documentation
- Initial thinking and conceptual foundations

## Key Documents
- `comprehensive-framework.md`: High-level overview of the project's conceptual approach
- `brain-zones-analysis.md`: Detailed analysis of neurological zones and their interactions
- `network-state-optimization.md`: Strategies for optimizing cognitive network states

## Rationale
These documents serve as the intellectual backbone of the project, bridging theoretical neurological models with practical software implementation while maintaining scientific validity.
